0,@Peter_Mugridge @upfieldglobal So we're in conversation with all UK retailers about the specific products that they stock. Right now for our 1KG product you might be best looking at Asda or Morrisons. Hope this helps!,,,,,
0,@Peter_Mugridge @upfieldglobal Hi Peter. Where are you shopping?,,,,,
0,@SchoolElstree @LondonMarathon Thanks for getting in touch, Lara – what a lovely story! If you’re able to DM us we can chat further.,,,,
0,@Teej82 We also launched Flora Plant, salted and unsalted - our vegan and dairy-free alternative to dairy butter which has carried The Vegan Society trademark and dairy-free certification on pack since launch. We hope this information helps and we wish you a great afternoon, Flora.,,,
0,@Teej82 We want to reassure all consumers wanting to avoid dairy for health reasons that we do have certified dairy-free products in our range including Flora Original and Flora Light which now have the dairy-free certification on pack.,,,,,
0,@Teej82 This change has been communicated on our social channels, website, and through proactive media outreach. We’ve also raised awareness of the new recipe in-store.,,,
0,@Teej82 The addition of buttermilk is clearly reflected in the ingredients list on the product and we have added a highlight on the front of the pack saying ‘Blended with buttermilk’. Flora Buttery has not been and is not suitable for those with dairy allergies.,,,,,
0,@Teej82 At Flora, the health and well-being of our customers is paramount. Following a recipe change, Flora Buttery spread now contains buttermilk and therefore we have removed The Vegan Society trademark from packs containing the new recipe.,,,
0,@Teej82 Hi Tajesh, thanks for reaching out. We are very sorry to hear that you are not happy with the changes made to the Flora Buttery recipe in October 2020.,,,,
0,@Kopaloff Hello Stephen, To clarify," the label highlights ""for a dairy free alternative suitable for vegans"," try Flora Original or Flora Light"" to offer vegan &amp; dairy free alternatives of Flora Buttery which are Flora Original &amp; Flora Light. We hope that this clarifies this. Thanks! Flora",,
0,@Bhakti_1 We can confirm that there are 69.4 Calories per 10g portion of Flora Original. We hope this helps, thanks, Flora.,,,
