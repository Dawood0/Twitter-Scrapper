0,Ah, well. Last time I turn to @NBCSports. Supposed to be running the world chess championships. Last time they lied, and ran a car auction instead. This time it�s swimming.

No use tuning in when you can�t depend on what it claims to be showing.
0,(Re)watching the original Hail Mary game. Saw Drew Pearson catch a ball and fall out of bounds.

Then saw a Minnesota sideline security guard run up and deliberately kick Pearson in the leg while he was down.

Yep, that�s sure a classy organization.
0,Gotta love that special brand of idiocy that is @amazon. Start typing a search. Search box suggests a line that exactly matches what I�m searching for, so I accept the suggestion. It returns 3 pages of results, precisely none of which match the search line.

0,I�m reluctantly leaning towards staying home a few more months. It�s not a fear of flying; it�s a fear of who I�d be flying with.

0,A tip, from nearly a half-century of experience in software:

Most employers will not help you to grow your skills and knowledge beyond your current responsibility. Some will even try to prevent it.

Stick your fingers into new tech. Future you will be glad current you did.
0,Judicial reform idea:

Supreme Court reduced to a single 18-year term, no reappointments, staggered to one expiring every 2 years (current ones to retire every 2 years, most senior first). Senate has 180 days to confirm, or justice is automatically confirmed.
0,Watching @NBCSports  half-hour shorts on the Chess World Championship. As a chess player, unsatisfying and too short, but as a vehicle to reach people who barely know the pieces, probably good.

But the font nerd in me is wigging out over the serif font in the logo design.

0,Try asking, �what can I do to help?� NOT, �here�s what I did before.�
0,@MayorJenny Today you said �dialog is better� but you don�t seem to realize that protests start dialog. The people want your ear, won�t you listen? All I hear so far is complaining about the property damage.
0,@MayorJenny Have you no words to tell the people of the city that you hear them, and you are committed to holding out of control police accountable? What kind of leader are you? Not one I�ll vote for.
0,@GovInslee The police are inciting fear, don�t you get that? Police are causing the violence in these peaceful protests, all across the country. The police are the danger.
0,@GovInslee @CityofSeattle @WANationalGuard But I�m guessing they will have batons,  shields, mace, etc. Don�t kid yourself. The people will still be under the boot.

0,The perpetuation of this mythological equivalence gives companies a figleaf to hide the proliferation of extremism, paranoia and division on their platforms, the concomitant harvesting, exploitation of user data, the violation of the social contract. @rachelerman @lizzadwoskin
0,Corporate management of user generated content is not "policing" since companies have no legal mandate, and the government ensuring First Amendment Rights--that, say, journalists are not jailed or killed for their work--are two different things:

0,Look up Christopher belter. A judge said incarceration isn�t appropriate for this person. Christopher is 20 years old  now. The crime he committed was when he was 16 or 17 years old. He did plead guilty in 2019.  If Christopher were not rich, in my opinion he would be in prison

0,Ah, well. Last time I turn to @NBCSports. Supposed to be running the world chess championships. Last time they lied, and ran a car auction instead. This time it�s swimming.

No use tuning in when you can�t depend on what it claims to be showing.
0,(Re)watching the original Hail Mary game. Saw Drew Pearson catch a ball and fall out of bounds.

Then saw a Minnesota sideline security guard run up and deliberately kick Pearson in the leg while he was down.

Yep, that�s sure a classy organization.
0,Gotta love that special brand of idiocy that is @amazon. Start typing a search. Search box suggests a line that exactly matches what I�m searching for, so I accept the suggestion. It returns 3 pages of results, precisely none of which match the search line.

Totally useless.
0,@sjs856 Worst thing that happened to Justin Fields was getting drafted by the Bears. That franchise has been where QBs get quietly smothered for nearly a century. Even Jim McMahon barely survived being there.

A secret Sid Luckman cult there ensuring his dominance in franchise history?
0,I�m reluctantly leaning towards staying home a few more months. It�s not a fear of flying; it�s a fear of who I�d be flying with.

Terrorists. Not the ones with bombs and guns; the ones who may start a fight just to avoid simple common-sense steps to avoid endangering others.
0,A tip, from nearly a half-century of experience in software:

Most employers will not help you to grow your skills and knowledge beyond your current responsibility. Some will even try to prevent it.

Stick your fingers into new tech. Future you will be glad current you did.
0,Judicial reform idea:

Supreme Court reduced to a single 18-year term, no reappointments, staggered to one expiring every 2 years (current ones to retire every 2 years, most senior first). Senate has 180 days to confirm, or justice is automatically confirmed.
0,Watching @NBCSports  half-hour shorts on the Chess World Championship. As a chess player, unsatisfying and too short, but as a vehicle to reach people who barely know the pieces, probably good.

But the font nerd in me is wigging out over the serif font in the logo design.
0,@marcasg Looking like the Quadfather is making the Rams defense a third down offer they can�t refuse.

Or stop.
0,So, let me get this straight: Aaron Rodgers mentions his �Covid toe� on some podcast or other, and because *he* didn�t know that was a real thing, he thinks *he* deserves an apology?

0,@AJKandy Many people do go to Ikea to pick things out then order them for delivery. But I think part of the appeal (as with any store) is being able to bring the items home immediately. I remember being so excited to buy new Ikea furniture and put it together as soon as I got home.

0,@AJKandy Many people do go to Ikea to pick things out then order them for delivery. But I think part of the appeal (as with any store) is being able to bring the items home immediately. I remember being so excited to buy new Ikea furniture and put it together as soon as I got home.

0,Hey good news, I'm starting a virtual, 6-week Purity Culture Recovery Group (for people in CA only, sorry!) in February 2022! I hope this is the start of many more collective healing groups. You can sign up for more info here: https://t.co/lxt01j5Kin
0,I meant "heal" not "health" in that first tweet dammit. hahaha. You get me. Maybe. idk! But my point is - look for people who are doing work that leads to behavior changes. It's subtle and hard, but I've learned so much. &lt;3
0,There's plenty of room for mistakes, being a whole person, &amp; messiness in exvangelical/religious trauma healing communities, but there also can't be leaders who choose to label their poor behavior as trauma responses but are also telling/selling YOU how to heal trauma responses.
0,It has mattered so much to me to see people with trauma like mine who will heal publicly, not just excuse when it's convenient. That's my hope, too. To share that healing is difficult and uncomfortable and ongoing but you won't be as reactive someday.
0,@diannaeanderson I am never wrong about tv shows (I am frequently wrong about tv shows)
0,Look for people who are accountable to their communities, to the public, who apologize, who try again, who do NOT use their trauma as an excuse for poor behavior or to deflect criticism. Look for people who can model how to hold discomfort and challenge and actually HEAL.
0,I'm not saying helpers and healers won't have trauma or trauma responses. I'm saying those who choose to use their platforms ethically will model some of the HOW of healing trauma in their public work.
0,Just a FYI to beware of people who advise others on how to health trauma responses who also...use trauma responses as an excuse for their own behavior.

0,@Kopaloff Hello Stephen, To clarify, the label highlights "for a dairy free alternative suitable for vegans, try Flora Original or Flora Light" to offer vegan &amp; dairy free alternatives of Flora Buttery which are Flora Original &amp; Flora Light. We hope that this clarifies this. Thanks! Flora
