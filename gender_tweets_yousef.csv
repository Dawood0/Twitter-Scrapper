0,@nikillinit I think it�s pretty clear. I�m a believer in path-dependent change. So, it�ll be more market driven. Govt will still be a major payer. Maybe becoming the biggest payer. But the delivery of care and the experience of care will all be market driven.

0,@peter_szilagyi @kelseyhightower @FilFoundation It's easy for Filecoin and IPFS to be additive like this because they were built to be, but I do think the emerging work now is building more glue between "web3" systems -- and even more importantly, providing interop with *existing* decentralized tools and protocols outside web3
0,@peter_szilagyi @kelseyhightower @FilFoundation a caching or CDN-like system -- like, of course, IPFS, which it complements. So IFPS isn't a panacea; Filecoin doesn't offer realtime access; but Filecoin lets you have a stable, incentivized decentralized backing store for the  decentralized realtime cache/CDN system.
0,@peter_szilagyi @kelseyhightower ... and I'd actually say (tho I would, because I work for @filfoundation) that IPFS and Filecoin is a good example of that composition. Filecoin on its own is not (yet!) tooled to be a realtime data storage mechanism; but that's because it's designed to be behind
0,@peter_szilagyi @kelseyhightower Having watched how long it took for LAMP to come together, I do think that it's possible to build a Web3 stack -- and it's kind of necessary, because there's not much point to building a decentralized system that nonetheless depends on a sizeable chunk of centralized services.
0,@peter_szilagyi @kelseyhightower [REPLY GUY BURSTS INTO THREAD] I think the emerging solution here is stitching solutions around the emerging stack which when composed together is better than the sum of its parts (or comparable centralized services)

0,@megankatenelson My sibs and I played a game as kids - if chicken was dinner one of us said "what a foul dinner", and the next kid followed w/ another pun. The object of the game was to tell the last pun before someone got a timeout. That it was a game drove my mother crazy.

0,Contemplating....typing.....breathing
0,I wonder with Eckhart Tolle if sometimes surrender means giving up trying to understand and becoming comfortable with not knowing...
0,I wonder with Chris Pine how to gain a different perspective these days since I don't have control over the situation but I do have a choice about how I wanna view it...
0,I wonder why we so often spend more time thinking and talking about what we�re going to change � as we spend actually changing it...
0,I wonder if we too often solve the wrong problem since we often don't spend enough time in the beginning to figure out what the real problem is...
0,I wonder what happens if I perceive the task of changing my bad habits on a day to say basis not as a problem or a challenge, but instead much more as an opportunity...
0,I wonder how we would feel in the evening if we counted our blessings instead of our shortcomings during the whole day...
0,I wonder these times how I can prevent that what is happening around me gets inside me � since ships don�t sink because of the water around them but because of the water that gets in them...
0,I wonder how to get through these tough times without being discouraged: by recalling that everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was � as Richard L. Evans pointed out...
0,I wonder if I should become more like Picasso who said: �I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it...�
0,I wonder if it's true, as marie curie once said, that nothing in life is to be feared but only to be understood. if so, it's time now to understand more, so that we may fear less...
0,I wonder if the struggles we're in today is a chance for us to develop different kind of strengths we need for tomorrow...
0,I meant to write Date* night not dat night, though both seem appropriate in this context.
0,Early 2000s: the absurdist backlash sets in. Scripts are cut, focus on food returns. More dat nights, less family. New dishes are focus, along with �all you can eat.� Music: jangly Muzak.

Mid 2000s. Calories and health. Boundaries and manners. Joke free. Music: contemporary. /f
0,Early 1990s: scripted, narratives focusing on family. Minimal references to Italy. Music: 1950s pop a la Frank Sinatra

Late 1990s: ads jump the shark. Absurdist scripted stories break fourth wall. Almost no discussion of food outside of sharing it with everyone. Music: American
0,Early 1980s: minimal scripted acting, heavy emphasis on a focal dish, history, and �speaking a different language.� Music: light classical 

Later 1980s: even balance of scripted acting and introduction of �family� themes. Music: popular opera

0,ICYMI: The US government's scheme targeted at Chinese industrial espionage and national security has seen hundreds of investigations since 2018. But @techreview's data shows that the entire enterprise is a mess of mission creep and failed prosecutions. 
https://t.co/j8un9i2P7p
0,Two days after MIT Technology Review requested comment from the DOJ regarding the initiative, the department made significant changes to its own list of cases.
That included deleting ones it had previously crowed about but later failed.

0,We found the government had no data or even *definition* of this thing it kept shouting about. 
It included cases with no national security element�such as a turtle smuggling ring�and had shifted over time to focus on researchers accused over their links to Chinese universities. https://t.co/veYBUuPcHI
0,The Dept of Justice has been targeting cases linked to China for several years, and claiming great success. 

For months I worked with @eileenguo @jess_aloe and @_KarenHao to compile data that shows that the government claims are wildly off base and damaging US innovation. https://t.co/j9c6OBfxGo

0,@zgeballe But people who have kids do� and this one is off to bed at 8:30pm after two weeks of late games
0,@zgeballe Even from a $ standpoint I don�t buy it� a commercial must sell for more at 7pmET than 12amET. But they�re acting like the game will be over in 3 hours and west coast fans still commute home from work at 5pm. Meanwhile most of the country sleeps through their championship

0,@chopaganda I have both styles and the toaster version is maybe easier to clean, but is more of a toaster oven that blows air around. It doesn�t work nearly as well as the �traditional� air fryer.
0,@chopaganda The frustrating part about the mini kit was that I couldn�t even hear what Trey was doing with it.  He might as well have walked off stage and taken a piss as far as my ears were concerned.
0,@tourphish @phish Haven�t been able to spot myself in the crowd, but it�s fun reliving the experience

0,@SlatteryLive Hi, Tony? May I ask you if you know whatever happened to the fringed, leather jacket you used to have? You wore it on episodes of Whose Line, Room 101 (1993), and Noel's House Party (1998), and also Doctor Who audition (1994). https://t.co/Vtp0RC86Hv

0,@TheDoochMan  Hi, Danny! Is it true that you know Japanese? I've been interested in Japanese culture ever since my mother went there in 1984. Tried to learn Japanese a long time ago with instructional CD's, found it very hard! How long did it take you?

0,@shortshift3 They destroyed a couch that was a lovely nubby wool, redid it in velvet two years ago, and no scratching.  We are now redoing the dining room chairs and the little ottomans in a similar velvet.  I think low plush with a very tight/smooth backing seems to be best.
0,@shortshift3 Fit feels a lot like a very cushy suede. But the cats can�t get their claws into it and it isn�t as satisfying as their scratcher.

0,@naomialderman I was touring with a Norwegian band through America at the time, and they all thought the story was hilarious and wondered why we were so obsessed with it. They thought it was fine for the president to have sexual relations with an intern, and that Americans were puritanical.

Religions where also at the base of the biggest wars and still are.

0,@realDonaldTrump Oh, but how did you let this happen on your watch???
0,@Albeardy @HabitatUK @habitat Cancelled my order. Don't trust them not to go bust and take my money. In Ikea. Got a lot more for my money and delivery same day. #service
0,@HabitatUK I'll need this...after spending 6 weeks waiting for you to deliver a table, and 2 failed deliveries at the 11th hour. #shabitat
0,@HabitatUK @Colglover70 Transferred from where??? China? Heard this excuse so many times. I could transfer a sofa on my back from Glasgow to London quicker!
0,@thepennyslane @livpurvis @HabitatUK @johnlewisretail Jeez. Not @HabitatUK. Just read their non delivery tweets and Trusted Pilot reviews first. Shocking service! Take money. No delivery.
0,@HabitatHelp @philipgwebb Or how about @habitathelp actually be helpful and phone your customer??? We shouldn't be chasing you!
0,@moigescr @HabitatUK We did the same! Too many implausible excuses. They asked us to wait another fortnight! Like I haven't already waited 3 x fortnights.
0,@LAU4A @Mazzariah @HabitatUK I asked for a full refund. Downloaded their 2016 accounts from companies house beta service. Not a good read xx
0,Please check latest Trusted Pilot Reviews for a whole bunch of disgruntled customer reviews. Money taken. No delivery. #shabitat https://t.co/kOgRIpeE2w
0,@Habitatuk would your latest set of financials be an explanation for the failure to make you deliveries. Operating losses, insolvent BS??
