1,@ricburton Is that the PlayStation 5
1,@dhh @basecamp Any major issues so far?

Congrats on the launch
1,@RyanBreslow US already marching towards isolationism since 2016, this just furthers the trend. Securing + vertically integrating (in US) things like medical supply chains will be seen as a matter of national security. If it’s in another country, it can’t be relied on in an emergency
1,@RyanBreslow Maybe not - a reduction in off shore production as a result of supply chain disruption leads us to be less economically dependent on others (which was the main driver of peace since WWII). Safe for now but destabilizing long term

1,@marcushurst Para rascarte la espalda como los osos
1,@xmlhack Oh, yea, how can one forget about the well know practice of companies proactively removing you from their mailing list
1,@OnlyConnectQuiz watching this week's episode, the question in round 1 that has the clue "Friday 13th Villain"... Surely that is wrong, since Jason was the villain from the Halloween franchise, and the Friday 13th was Freddy... #error #omg #howcouldyou!
1,@teengkoh @teegstar @normanswan I get it though. And we did AZ for dose #1, then Pfizer for #2. It's a good combo, lots of people here in Canada have done that.
1,Google adds 50+ more financial institutions to Pay in Canada, one of them is not @TD_Canada who insist on using their own app which is incompatible with anything else. Get with it, TD. #fail #stillwaiting
1,@TD_Canada @trinitrontv ...making you the ONLY major Canadian bank not to. Your own app sucks - so why not actually make it easy on yourselves and support the largest customer base apps?
1,@pcasey @larrylarry @BikeShareTO @transitapp @TOMayorTroy You should probably email @TOmayor1 instead, since that's the real Mayor of Toronto...
1,@TOBikeShareBot ... and how many of them used the @transitapp integration you just canned? Me, always for one.
1,@BreannaFuss @pfizer @FedEx @UPS I hope @FedEx are better at delivering that than my package which is now waiting for it's third "guaranteed" delivery date.
1,@TD_Canada when will Google Pay be supported? You're the only major bank in Canada trying to force customers into your own sad, inferior system. It's making customers (like me) migrate away from your cards.
#bad #fail #useless #inferior
1,@TD_Canada @wildrice77 And your app (bad, clunky, outdated) only lets me pay with one card. Whilst Google pay lets me use any of my other credit AND debit cards. So guess which one I use? (Hint: it's not yours). Get on Google pay. You're the last one who isn't.
1,@AshLightQ @shortrd @HeleneShaw17 @intheMatrixxx @clbrownjr @POTUS @HugsOverMasks You rarely get asked because it clearly marks you as an ignorant asshole not worth going near.
1,Funny thing... 3 packages coming via @canadaposthelps , none arrived on time... Days late. 
2 from FedEx and DHL? Bang on time. Exactly when they said.
#canadapostsucks #fail #useless
1,@canadaposthelps thanks a bunch. Packages, 2 of, now gone from guaranteed delivery yesterday to guaranteed delivery today by end of day to guaranteed delivery tomorrow by end of day.

1,I've just had yet more spam from @canadaposthelps about "Getting your business back to business".

Since the last 2 parcels I am waiting for have been sat in a depot for 14 days unmoving, the best way to get back to business is to NOT use Canada Post.

#fail #pathetic #noservice
1,@canadaposthelps a delay means you may possibly deliver at some point. So far you give me no confidence that this is the case. https://t.co/E5PIXC57tl

1,When playing Plague Inc, the path to win is to evolve your virus to be a highly infectious mild illness &amp; while it spreads globally, save your DNA points for the final evolutions to add lethality. Then you sit back &amp; watch the world dissolve. #Omicron https://t.co/7NDUSr8xJb

1,@LesIsMore1 I'd be interested if you find it!
1,@LesIsMore1 I imagine when you are hungry and have no other choices you worry a lot less about the quality of the calories. That's why spam was invented haha.
1,It's really important that every household has a non-perishable supply of food (medicines/pet supplies/water) for atleast 72 hours. Two weeks might be more prudent.

Try to focus on foods you don't have to cook. Track your expiry dates (many foods are good for years past this). https://t.co/e5TfkDDqD0
1,@eissyrc @phendrana Your parents are wrong of course, but they might just be too scared to imagine what the world is coming too. It's easier to pretend everything is normal and will always be ok for your grandkids, etc.

The alternative is terrifying.
1,@phendrana @GettinShifDone I think of Iceland every single day
1,@LesIsMore1 If you want to pretend the current government isn't responsible for a 2020 public document, then at least consider they created a culture this sentiment could exist within?

And if that's true its a red flag that battle lines should been drawn before.

1,Are you kidding me @MayorJenny ?! #resign #defundthepolice https://t.co/xOYZ5ge4zc
1,@ericacbarnett @MayorJenny Great question, btw. Too bad she didn’t answer it. These pandemic press conferences make it pretty easy for the moderator to mute any reporters who try to pressure the mayor to answer the question asked.
1,Try asking, “what can I do to help?” NOT, “here’s what I did before.”
1,@MayorJenny Today you said “dialog is better” but you don’t seem to realize that protests start dialog. The people want your ear, won’t you listen? All I hear so far is complaining about the property damage.
1,@MayorJenny Have you no words to tell the people of the city that you hear them, and you are committed to holding out of control police accountable? What kind of leader are you? Not one I’ll vote for.
1,@GovInslee The police are inciting fear, don’t you get that? Police are causing the violence in these peaceful protests, all across the country. The police are the danger.
1,@GovInslee @CityofSeattle @WANationalGuard But I’m guessing they will have batons,  shields, mace, etc. Don’t kid yourself. The people will still be under the boot.
1,@MayorJenny This curfew just gives police more power to inflict violence. I’d like a mayor who is okay with losing a cop car so that citizens can voice their discontent with the system.

1,@mollybloom @poolside Seeing Stevie Wonder live had always been a hole in my live music repertoire. I finally got to see him play in 2014 on his Songs in the Key of Life tour, then again in 2017 at Jazzfest in NOLA. It was such an honor to be in his presence while he performed.

1,@4Most_gg @RalphHaley10 @RJvXP The original article is still online. While this is a neutral review, the old text has the label "feature". In this case, I guess feature means rant.
1,@RobinWithTheD @MarcusStewart7 Ah, I read the "feature" not the "review". Google "gameinformer young souls" and you'll find the text I was mentioning. Pretty sad read. I can send the link you you don't find it.

1,At a very young age I noticed a majority of people were living their lives in a ‘loop’. 

Same town, same job, no travel, no margin, strict life schedule, little or no ownership - just ‘getting by’. 

Most of them had no problem living that way, I just knew I wasn’t going to.

1,@Quan i thought it was more the fly recognized that he was a piece of shit
1,@martinmroz @siong1987 lol careful you don't get the account closed like @lg did because he was "cash advancing" himself
1,@manolosavi dell i think probably comes up short in the resolution department, since their only 100W PD monitors that i know of are all 4k and under. if you really don't need &gt; 4k you can maybe get away with something that's not the apple display, but higher resolution + 100W PD is tough
1,@manolosavi i have no idea about color accuracy so that's on you, but in terms of resolution + power, i think you'll be hard pressed to find things &gt; 4k that also support 90-100W PD. eve spectrum may fit the bill for 4k + 100W PD, but they're potentially vaporware
1,@manolosavi what sort of display you looking for (size, resolution, other "nice to haves")? i can think of a few that might be able to push 100W PD but all come with tradeoffs
1,@siong1987 @martinmroz As soon as your country will let me in

1,@chenosaurus yeah, command key works. you gotta hit a hardware switch on the side of the keyboard to change which mode (win / osx) you have it on, but other than that everything works
1,@chenosaurus for what it's worth i keep it on windows mode in linux as well because i like to keep the super -&gt; win key mapping rather than cmd -&gt; win key mapping. let me test it real quick on osx, i'm sure i have a macbook somewhere
1,@chenosaurus does windows + linux count?

1,@JeffWMontague "what if our product lineup was completely governed by our promotion cycle requirements?"
1,@JeffWMontague eh for what it's worth i think a lot of the issues are tied to SMS / MMS. i very rarely text people and don't run into these sorts of issues, it's just that not many people are on hangouts anymore so i gotta run the entire gamut of apps (whatsapp/fb/signal/telegram/etc)

1,@hotelzululima Ah, that’s no problem: keep Sonic internet, amd get Cable from the cable guy. There’s no need to bundle.
1,If you know anyone who could have Sonic fiber but they’re still using Cable, three points:

They can keep cable TV and just switch internet to Sonic fiber!

1,I'd like a kosher standards process waiver placed over every intellectual property claim made since January '05. The kosher standards agreements that provide health quality approval to inventors are damage waivers to protect ownership when accidents get sent to manufacturing.
1,The weight of carrying team morale responsibilities to a team of predominantly men is a difficult complexity to manage when air quality conditions for team morale must balance production quality homework &amp; security compliance for new @voicesofrageandopposition.
1,If it is in my power to prevent @voicesofrageandopposition from being silenced it will only be a result of my rich appreciation for the traditional and kosher storytelling values of what makes @realdesignhistoryimprovementunderstanding possible.
1,San Francisco is a trade estate for @realdesigneducationhistory and @voicesofrageandopposition, in that order. When @realdesigneducationfunding isn't protected neither are @realvoicesofrageandopposition.
1,To personify abhorrent behavior is to come closer to understanding ways of identifying biases towards perspectives which may not contain universal quality.
1,People are only as impressed w/the building quality of your investments when they are free to understand the amount of universal complexity that your constraint factors must account for in order for @realdesignmilitarysafetysecurity to not 'lose' @realdesignteacherseriesfunding.
1,My job involves learning how to offend people 'better' so that response quality funding is informed by @realteacherseries. If I've offended you, you have likely taught me something significant about design education funding.
1,Where our ability to protect rich storytelling in design education funding is flawed, shared understanding in history is errored. Where we make mistakes in the workplace, we also must unlearn to provide better design education quality funding to next generation teacher series.
1,I'm 1/2 Persian, 1/2 German which some may say bears the mark of possesing Aryan values where 'race' is concerned. 
If it is any condolence, I share the kosher values of traditional trade enforcement as a value investment into the safekeeping &amp; storytelling of treasured history.
1,This isn't a process that is sustainable in nature when metric design analysis for security health building is not also protecting the building design security of @realmilitaryengineering as a trade value investment for supporting men as engineers with unique needs.
1,The language dimension funding of @mywork are security dimensions to fund qualitative health production quality so that as engineering teams diversify, language diversifies as well.
1,There is also nothing unusual about engineering teams having a shortage of perspectives from women.

1,@derrickreimer @derrickreimer this is a little funny.  Seems like being great at UX could be a distinct disadvantage in early days for similar reasons. In short if your product has (ahem) LOTS of room for improvement but sells anyway AND people stick around - you might be onto something.
1,@derrickreimer Huh. Really interesting point. Some thoughts: Hype gets you traffic. Traffic == data that we need to iterate, to learn and to get to product-market-fit. BUT people don't stay bc of hype. So DO  hype! But watch those churn numbers and how people vote with time, $$ and attn.

1,@Caltrain what's going on with SB288? Some folks at PAL have been waiting forever. First for 386. Now 288 delay keeps growing. Don't keep us in the dark
1,@gowave_g I have Wave Gigabit at THREE different properties in Washington and Silicon Valley. Will be canceling all three before next billing cycle. Sounds like other residents in my buildings plan on doing the same. At least Comcast picks up the phone. https://t.co/aKee5D9ghy
1,@gowave_g Do you know how hard it is to be WORSE than Comcast Xfinity? They're the gold standard for awful and here you guys are, two weeks in a row for me, making them look good/reliable/efficient.
1,@gowave_g I was quoted an "up to 20 minute" wait. At 1h12m now. This is absurd. Dialed from another phone and it's up to 30 minutes already. No internet svc. Wanted to support the little guys but these consistent outages and crappy svc means it's time to go back to Xfinity. https://t.co/0JPhtYQQVL
1,@djlk @tcortese @yony_feng @onepeloton Same situation with me. I'm getting 120mbps down and the last couple of days it's either been super laggy, or completely unusable on the bike (non-live) and app (non-live). Trash
1,@AskAmex That was over 7 days ago. I've heard nothing from them. So this is all rather useless. The main 800# gets me nowhere
1,@AskAmex Multiple reps on MR and regular cust svc last week said they opened "a formal complaint" on my behalf "with corporate."
1,@AskAmex $200k. $288k in the last 18 months. All going to Citi and Chase, because of this.
1,@AskAmex I'd like "someone from corporate" to reach out, so that they can know why I'll be shifting this $200k annual spend to Chase/Citi
1,@AskAmex Everyone I spoke with on the phone kept saying they couldn't help be "because this is handled by corporate."
1,@AskAmex I would like to be contacted via email or phone by someone responsible for this fiasco with my membership rewards account
1,@AskAmex Unfortunately you were the first an only Amex Person in 2 weeks to offer any substantive assistance, which is still frustrating.

1,@iam_preethi I think it's precisely because of this lack of certainty about what lies ahead, this  awareness of life's infinite possibilities that we can hope for happier moments.
We shouldn't deny the possibility that we may have indeed lived through our happiest (or darkest) moments though
1,@iam_preethi We can't decide which are our happiest moments until we've gone through all of them, can we?
The assumption that our inability to cope with 'things only getting worse' is why we can't recognize our happiest moments seems far-fetched at best.
Interesting perspective nevertheless

1,@seldo Don’t think of leasing as you “renting” a car the dealership owns, and instead it’s a car you own, with the option to give it back to the dealership after 3/4/5 years. You definitely have an option to buy the car in your contract, which is most definitely favorable to you.

1,@nsfmc Not sure exactly which moments you're thinking of (and I don't want to give spoilers), but the ones I have in mind probably work for all players, because you're run through the "normal" versions of those conventions enough times before they bring out the warped version.

1,...
1,Pianomania: Makes me wonder how I will ever get such an ear for sounds. Lovely to see how musicians get caught up in the details of music.
1,Les Amours Imaginaires: Showing a soap drama story in style, pretty colors, good music & slow motion evrn makes it more annoying & shallow
1,Somewhere: Sophia wanted to give us a look at an empty life, but she chose the most uninteresting scenes & forgot something called "pacing"
1,Enter the Void: The story was really stretched out, but visualy really impressive. I just wished I saw it under influence! :)
1,Napoleon Dynamite: really really dry, but funny though. Is it me or was there no background  music at all?
1,Shortbus: For most people this might be a shocking movie, but for me it was interesting to see what actually happens in the "underground".
1,Harry Potter The Half Blood Prince: Didn’t understand crap from both the plot and the rules of magic. It’s like a big teen drama. Not for me
1,Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines: It’s like one episode stretched. The plot was just “escape” and the action was disappointing.
1,Megane: A slow-paced movie which is never boring, but funny because of the weird characters. All the shown food made me hungry though!
1,Resident Evil Degeneration: It’s like one big cutscene from a RE-game. The story wasn't interesting, neither was the action
1,Lesbian Vampire Killers: Could've been funnier, but they were so caught up in making it "funny in style" that it gotten serious instead
1,Sixteen Candles: The eighties vibe is pretty cool and it had funny and clever moments, but other than that not the classic as it said it is.
1,Rachel Getting Married: An in-your-face life drama, which had a good premise, but lacked subtlety. Didn't really do it for me though.
1,iCarly - iGo to Japan: Three episodes smashed in one, making it not really a movie (and not in Japan either). Still fun to watch though.
1,Knowing: Interesting concept for a paranoia thriller and had an okay first half. Second half felt like Spielberg, which is really meh to me.
1,It’s hard to believe it’s happening, but the best day in NY is almost upon us. Hope to see you somewhere between the Verrazzano and Central Park. https://t.co/JC9QNP8Gya

1,@patricklenz Man that’s a visual. I’d love to see a purple low rider with flames here.
1,Food delivery in Berlin has gotten really tricky lately. Seems like a combo of low rider supply and high buyer demand. And probably dynamics that aren’t as easily seen.
1,My guess is that you’ve uploaded the new app without enabling in the US store. Bummer.
1,@foodpanda_de I’ve been using your app in Berlin (downloaded and still available from the US App Store), but recently it’s locked me out asking me to use the “new” app. The link takes me to the App Store but it’s not avail in my store. https://t.co/LBEIizXjRG
1,@BWJones @sussman Me neither, even tho people frequently think I work for them.
1,That's a bunch of "fucks", but I'm in a rush to sign out of here and go have lunch with Kristina and the cats.

See you on the other side, I hope.
1,And finally, stop claiming that you're going to change Jack's mind, or Zuckerberg's mind from within.

Get someone with a moral compass in your life to look you in the eye and ask what the fuck you think you're doing, because what the fuck *do* you think you'e doing?
1,If you have the agency, stop working there. Stop giving your days away to Trump. You could be with friends, with family, with nature, but instead you're sitting in front of a computer every day and working to make a better megaphone for fascists, racists, and capitalists.
1,If you work on these sites, and you have agency, what the fuck are you doing choosing to give your time/energy/approval to them? How are you shaking your head at the news that Trump might reject the election results, then providing labor to the people who own his megaphones?
1,But it's been a long time since I've been able to look my wife in the eye when she asks why I think this site is any different than Facebook. It's not, and hasn't been for many years.

I'm disgusted with myself for pretending otherwise.
1,I had higher hopes for twitter, which I've used it since it was running on Jack's laptop, and which was created by people I liked and admired (I owe a tremendous personal debt to many of them).

For the last 14+ years I've made friends on here, found work, and shared my life.
1,I never signed up for Facebook, because it was clearly a toilet from day one. These days we know the organization is also dangerous and amoral and profits from the chaos they enable.

I'm disgusted that anyone with any agency works there, or on Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, etc.
1,After 14.5 years on here I can no longer bear to associate myself with @twitter.

Jack, and every single person who works on twitter, profit by providing a platform for Trump and his ilk in their march towards fascism, and then they profit again by hosting our outraged responses.
1,I feel like we all say that the old model is unhealthy, but I've not seen anything else to replace it yet. Can anyone point me to good examples that I'm missing out on?
1,Are there any sites out there treating/presenting social signals (views/faves/comments) in a smart way, such that the value the site derives from them and assigns to the related content doesn't lead to a gaming of the system, or pressure to Like everything your contacts publish?

1,@TedBrodkin @ashleypallathra Thanks, @TedBrodkin and @ashleypallathra! I’d love to have a look at Missing Each Other. Curious if you have recommendations for building attunement in the remote workplace - over 50% of the workforce is looking to stay/go remote, yet the need for connection remains true!
1,When you add up the cost of hiring a new employee—recruiting, training the toll on productivity, paying a higher salary, etc., a bad hire can cost a company as much as $50,000.

Companies that invest in the right people and give them a fair salary are actually saving money.

1,@natashanyt The image recognition issues you wrote about also happen at a higher rate to women with short hair, men with long hair &amp; men with makeup https://t.co/lxy6hevoeY
1,Interestingly, @GoogleAI, the team with arguably the best image recognition technology, chooses not to label gender, unlike @azure, @awscloud, @clarifai &amp; @IBMWatson.
1,If you wear makeup, you are also more likely to be classified as female. https://t.co/BXfYg9ZHBl
1,Meanwhile, men with long blond hair, like @Saints linebacker @AlexAnzalone47, are also mislabelled at a higher frequency. https://t.co/r2xUMlv9K5
1,Women with short dark hair, like @katyperry here, are more likely to be misgendered than their blond counterparts. https://t.co/FTbAjw3Jug
1,Why? Probably because @maddow currently has short dark hair. These systems have no problem correctly labelling her when she had long blond hair. https://t.co/c0ohGQE2mi
1,@alexisohanian @AOC And the bias is not hard to find. If you are a man w long hair (like Saints linebacker @AlexAnzalone47) or a women w short hair (like @katyperry) - you can get misclassified by today's ML systems https://t.co/lxy6hevoeY https://t.co/AxxA3FBNID
1,@stevesi Great thread! At the very least it should be more transparent when things fail. It’s remarkable easy to break “authoritative” systems but there are few good tools to monitor these failures. https://t.co/lxy6hevoeY

1,I know some of you know the answer to this one, but I am curious what the general perception is... so it's time for a poll!

What is more heritable, intelligence or personality?
1,Similarly the courts: if you rule out reforming the Supreme Court you lower turnout by those who think (correctly) that the court is rigged. People vote not because it ensures the result they prefer; but they have to have confidence that the game is fair. https://t.co/W9DhBwjIbW
1,Trump realized that many Americans feel that the system is rigged against them. Democrats however stopped talking about corruption and corporate capture. The Hunter-Tucker story is a bigger deal electorally than people seem to realize.
1,The biggest mistake in American political discourse at the moment is delinking voting rights and corruption. If people think the system is rigged, their commitment to voting rightly diminishes. 1/

1,Generations of leaders here have put their heads together to help figure TC+ out, including @panzer and @pickavet on editorial, @jordanrcrook and the events team, @joeyhinson and co on the business side  — and departed colleagues @dannycrichton, @travisbernard and @neddesmond.

1,Just about EVERY Fire TV Smart TV is on sale right now (see list: https://t.co/eletA0Nrox) EXCEPT for this one, the 65” Fire TV Omni by Amazon (https://t.co/DCpb9BeBKP). What gives? Maybe it’s being saved for an exclusive Cyber Monday deal?
1,Example of a good bundle deal: Echo Show 5 Kids + Echo Dot Kids + Free Smart Bulb for $80 (https://t.co/cIPU9gX2EY). Buying the Echo Show and Echo Dot seperately you will pay $5 more and won’t get the free bulb. https://t.co/lTwQTVrHze
1,Example of a bad Amazon Black Friday deal: Echo + 2 Echo Dots bundle for $120 (https://t.co/oGVDBHlFed). If you buy the Echo ($60) and 2 Echo Dots ($30) individually, you’ll pay the same price and get 3 Free Smart Bulbs thrown in. https://t.co/NNFTxIlwsZ

1,@CwrwMe @All4 Ah, ok. That’s an Alexa Skill. You can tell by the icon in the upper right. Reboot by holding down SELECT and PLAY on the remote. That’ll stop it.
1,@CwrwMe Fire TV can play background audio from one app while you are in another. Sounds like that’s what’s happening. Force close all apps or reboot the stick to stop it.
1,The 3rd-gen Fire TV Stick at $20 is a seriously underated deal. All the attention is rightfully on the 4K Max for $35 because it’s the first sale ever and a great deal, but the power &amp; remote you get with the regular stick for just $20 is nuts. All deals: https://t.co/ZJy3aI85by
1,I’ve had 2 spam comments posted on @AFTVnews about PureVPN “deals” in the last 2 days. There is no affiliate link (just a generic link) included so I assume this is a spam campaign from PureVPN itself.  Not cool @PureVPNcom and welcome to my comment blacklist.

1,@NekkoAshii @JoyceHutchens3 @Phil_Lewis_ I agree. But the school shootings are mostly not military style rifles. This one was a small handgun stolen by a kid who was driven to psychopathy by our screwed up culture. You’d need outright gun band and proactive confiscation to have potentially avoided this.
1,@NekkoAshii @JoyceHutchens3 @Phil_Lewis_ I am probably very close to you philosophically. I agree with rights come responsibilities. I’m just pessimistic there is a legal way to fix this.
1,@NekkoAshii @samthebatfan @JoyceHutchens3 @Phil_Lewis_ Not murder people, not negligently store the firearms. Those are already laws. Laws don’t make people responsible, though, culture does. We have a sick culture. Canada has lots of guns and doesn’t have this problem.

1,@samthebatfan @NekkoAshii @JoyceHutchens3 @Phil_Lewis_ Do you have kids in public schools?
1,@paulhcassidy53 @a_centrism He was talking about the Russian collusion hoax. Your partisanship is showing.
1,@NekkoAshii @JoyceHutchens3 @Phil_Lewis_ Do you know the fraction of kids exposed to school shootings? It’s infinitesimal compared to the fraction of them given chronic anxiety by shrieking leftists using kids as pawns and scaring the shit out of them with your histrionics.
1,@Stacijoi @Phil_Lewis_ Our nation is damaged because we have guns?
1,@Stacijoi @Phil_Lewis_ We have gun reform. It doesn’t work unless you’re willing to confiscate them like Australia. When is it going to occur to you clueless blue wave types that this isn’t an option and maybe we should work on the problem.
1,@Desert_yoSemite @Phil_Lewis_ @HelenKennedy God that is a stupid and inaccurate  take. We’re not the most violent country by a wide margin. It’s more about poverty and inequality than gun access.

1,Hadn't planned on it, but I ended up doing a mini version of @WOOLandPRINCE's 100 Day challenge. Wore one of their tees all week while I was visiting family. Not sure if no one noticed, or if they were too nice to say something about my wearing the same shirt everyday.
1,In hindsight, it's also bonkers that record stores still exist ...
1,I had forgotten how my step-mother does the Korean thing of referring to my dad as "&lt;childs_name&gt; appa" (literally someone's dad).

1,@rbranson I found it inadequate to get 4K HDR at 60 fps from an Xbox Series X. I was trying to avoid getting a second Xbox by creating a reverse cable run...all the primary runs in the house use fiber which works well.
1,@rbranson @ablock It's just compatibility problems with updated formats like Atmos; not a bandwidth issue. Most manufacturers never update their firmware...HDFury does though.
1,@rbranson You will notice these are all 10 gbps signals or less.
1,@ablock @rbranson I think the HDFury 4K Maestro can carry every audio format but still limited to 18 gbps? I don't know if they have an 8K in the works but even HDFury depends on HDBaseT for their extenders.
1,@rbranson Maybe HDBaseT 3.0 is? 2.0 is definitely lossy-compressed ("visually lossless") and very noticeable above 10 gbps.
1,@rbranson They all use different versions of the same HDBaseT chipsets. The HDFury 4K Maestro is the best prosumer-level package for it. If you can run active fiber you will get a better picture because the compression can be lossless which a single CAT6 link cannot do.

1,@dacort I think you start getting to the point where you don’t want to spend your money replacing the same things over and over. Like how many irons should a person have to buy in their lifetime? There is comfort in a quality item that does it’s job well and is made to last

1,@Geek_Manager @sjwhitworth To be honest, in engineering I don't remember the veto ever being used. In a few cases positive feedback tipped the scales the other way, though. E.g. we hired one engineer specifically because a non-engineer said they thought they'd be a good teacher. But it wasn't v structured
1,@sjwhitworth Until we were around 20 people at Monzo, everyone met every hire and could veto them. I think that early team was the strongest team I've ever been in and carried the company very far

1,@metpoliceuk @MPSGreenwich That may be the current law. But stating that private e-scooters are “unfit for the road” is disingenuous and outright incorrect. A lot of private e-scooters are the same as rental scooters in specification if not better. Sure, state the law but do not spread false information.

1,@jonjonnyp In the Canaries? One or more Brits are definitely responsible for that.
1,A question not answered by this thread: 

“Is this a good tv show?”

Up to you, fam.
1,All this to say that I find the show extremely uncomfortable to watch. What I see in the show might be me reading too much into it, but if it’s intentional, I’m not sure that the average viewer would have the significantly stunted emotional development to recognise it.
1,Autism didn’t make me violent, but it did make me more likely to suffer the abuse that made me violent, which is what I’m seeing build in Marty.
1,The Autistic Community has been harmed over and over again by the unfounded stereotype of the violent autistic person, so I wanted to make my point explicit. Autistic people are more likely to be the victims of violence than non-Autistics.
1,**To be completely clear** I am not talking about Autism, or ADHD, or anything like that. I’m saying very literally that as an abused, traumatised child who was prone to violence, I see myself in him. Nothing more than that.
1,His confusion about the motives of those around him, the fundamental nature of his desires &amp; his authenticity all read… in a familiar way. To me Ferrell’s character is extremely relatable &amp; I think his performance is great, but people may not be familiar with anyone like Marty
1,The pain that comes across Ferrell’s face in some scenes is a look I’ve seen on angry, silent kids’ faces that makes me extremely uncomfortable, because of the violence those kids have been capable of. The symptoms of abuse I see in Ferrell’s character are very real to me.
1,Ferrell’s character is supposed to be an empty vessel for Rudd’s to use as a skin suit. I think Ferrell is pulling it off so well that people think his acting is empty. Marty’s stunted growth and lack of communication skills make it easy to miss the subtlety in his behaviours.
1,The fact that it’s written by (traditionally) comedic writers &amp; stars two (traditionally) comedic actors, I think lends itself to my point about it being intentionally uncomfortable because while there’s humour in the dialogue from here to there, the story is very much not funny
1,Full disclosure: I haven’t listened to the podcast &amp; I am only vaguely aware of the story it’s based on, so this is not an informed opinion: people are shitting on Will Ferrell saying that he brings nothing to this character, but I think that’s also on purpose.
1,“The Shrink Nextdoor” is deeply uncomfortable, and I think it’s truly supposed to be that way. A lot of people are saying it falls flat as a drama, a comedy, or a dramedy, but I genuinely think it was written to be terribly uncomfortable.

1,@DietPravda Havn’t seen milk creams, guava cheese or thali sweet. So you dont like rose cookies?
1,@DietPravda @darthdevi Will let you know if I see them but pretty sure you should find them in Thom’s or All Saints.

1,@AaronPogue @DamienWoods711 @chris_herd Corporations have a fiduciary duty to extract maximum value from the workers, so I'm not exactly sure what you see wrong with the workers doing the same.

1,@zarawesome @dailyshrdlu Depends what dictionary you favour. The Scrabble dictionary I filtered this bot through (it skips the 2% of deals with no solution) says not, but suggests 51 answers, including 16 actual everyday English words.
1,@FarbsMcFarbs @zarawesome @dailyshrdlu [GROANS]
1,@zarawesome Fixed. Thanks for the heads up.
1,@zarawesome Ah. No, two, I must have generated the latest version incorrectly when updating it the other day. Will fix it this evening.
1,@RedPenEleanor @dailyshrdlu Thank you!
1,@RedPenEleanor @dailyshrdlu Afraid that fails on the sixth letter, which isn't itself a repeat of any of the final three letters.

1,@monohymn @dailyshrdlu Your dictionary mileage may vary, but sure, it fits the cards.
1,@zarawesome Alright, it didn't take much to get @dailyshrdlu up and running, let's find out.
1,@kathrrak That's it, good call on BYWAY. The difficulty varies, I did deliberately pick a non-trivial example, there.
1,@zarawesome Ah, maybe. And I was tempted to construct the deck so that every deal would always be solvable - which seemed possible, but not worth sacrificing card design space for, when the script's solution could just be one stupidly obscure dictionary word.
1,@zarawesome That was my call as well. The brute force script I've been testing with gives 15 possible answers for that one.

1,@PapaLamb77 @tvladeck Deaths do not influence Rt - rather the other way around but likely lagged between 2-3 weeks. You may see spurious correlation because of that lag
1,@jeffmli Self taught would be a stretch but I only got so far as freshman cs at Stanford. So classes yes up to that point. Best way to learn something new is have a problem you want to solve but can only solve if you learn said thing. Feels like unlocking a level in a game.
1,@shellen Yes but I find that to be playing with fire. At this pt so many unpredictable human interventions that beyond a week it’s anyone’s guess.
1,@shellen Lol I thought you were saying my data work was not great. I get it now. But to be honest I’m not projecting anything only analyzing the past
1,@twiecki @tvladeck Lol you two
1,@Babak_Javid_Lab @ethanjweiss I agree with this 100%. That’s why we show state not national. It’s also why it’s important that state Rt drive further investigation into regions/counties/cities. But you’d only know to look by seeing something amiss at state level. At some pt you have to choose granularity
1,@ethanjweiss @Babak_Javid_Lab You use a collection of metrics one of which is Rt. In biz you look at rev, costs, customer count, churn, retention, etc. no one metric drives all your decisions. But to say rev is useless because there are ways it can be misleading is just wrong. You have to look at them all
1,@Babak_Javid_Lab @ethanjweiss You’re trying to discredit the whole via exception. If you can show that of the 3500 cases in the last 24hr in ca, Rt is primarily driven by meat-factory outbreaks I’m happy to move on. Ps factory workers and old folks are ppl too and Rt is just as valid for them
1,@ethanjweiss @Babak_Javid_Lab When numbers are tiny Rt is not as useful. So local prevalence needs a diff approach unless it’s a large city or county. I also won’t claim Rt is the only metric to use. It should be one in a toolkit of many to triangulate the situation
1,@Babak_Javid_Lab @ethanjweiss It would if you measured it for north and south separately - whenever you aggregate metrics you lose fidelity but the solution is to break it down further regionally not throw out the metric :)
1,@Babak_Javid_Lab @ethanjweiss I couldn’t disagree more. While states like Hawaii are in that boat (low prevalence) you cannot claim that is true in places like Arizona, Texas, or California. I’m also not sure what you mean by “this stage” - there are so many states seeing record highs.
1,@shua_bragg @tvladeck The build function of GenerativeModel. Look at the exposure term.
1,@amaiorana It’s an artifact of the Bayesian model. There are many more curves that can fit the cases we’re seeing because of the infection-&gt;report delay is random. It’s possible the line is higher or lower and we just haven’t seen those ppl reported yet
1,@_Parth_Sarthi Reported cases is a lagging indicator of actual infections so you should expect Rt to go below 1 before cases decline
1,@vk01 Never. To be fair most of this stuff we had to learn over past two months

1,Re-upping this powerful “Message from 2025” from @UNICEF on what happens to all of us if we don’t tackle COVID-19 everywhere. Seems very relevant today… https://t.co/5t6wgvN44j
1,You can read the report here: https://t.co/9pmB9irKGB
 
Or visit the (awesome) interactive site here: https://t.co/jwDyCCf2mL
1,Bottom line: While it’s cliché to point people to young people as a placeholder for hope, I’m going to go ahead and point you to young people as a placeholder for hope. I’m reminded of the MLK quote: ‘Change takes a long time. But it does happen.’ This is some evidence.
1,Notably, young people who are heavy internet users are more skeptical of online content than older folks. Among those who rely predominantly on social media to stay informed, 17% of young people on average report high levels of trust in such platforms compared to 24% of 40+’s.
1,Young people (the yellow bar in the below) are more trusting in doctors, scientists and the news media to provide accurate information, and less trusting of friends and family to do so. https://t.co/CkVS4UF8Xu
1,On average, 71 per cent of young people say it is somewhat or very important to treat LGBTQ+ people equally, versus 57 per cent older people. Young women are 10 percent more likely than young men to do so.
1,Young people exhibit more pluralistic values when asked about the treatment of people from other backgrounds, with the biggest difference being on LGBTQ+ rights.
1,Young people believe more in global cooperation. For example, in nearly every country surveyed, large majorities of young people report their countries would be safer from threats like COVID-19 if governments worked in coordination with other countries rather than on their own.
1,Young people (39 per cent) are on average almost twice as likely as older people (22 per cent) to identify most with being part of the world, versus their own nation or community. https://t.co/mW51lfd6pI
1,When asked if they identify most with their community, country or world, they're far more likely than the older generation to point to the world -- and that's true everywhere, in both developed and developing countries.
1,In spite of [gestures wildly at everything], we found strikingly high levels of optimism among the young. They are nearly 50 per cent more likely than older people to believe the world is becoming a better place with each generation.
1,Really interesting poll out today. Earlier this year, @UNICEF &amp; @GallupNews surveyed 15-24 &amp; 40+ year olds in 21 countries. The big takeaway…in spite of climate change, the global pandemic, growing inequality &amp; rising nationalism—the kids, as they say, are alright. 

A thread:
1,Just a regular reminder that, as of the first of this month, 80 percent of administered COVID vaccines were in wealthy countries. Just 1.5 percent have been in low-income countries. This is no way to end a pandemic.
1,@blackactivistw1 @UNICEF https://t.co/Idr9ili7tW

1,@GovernorWinslow @paytonperryts @RadioFreeTom Is there a safe and effective vaccination for HIV that people are refusing to take, while HIV ravages the country uncontrolled?
1,@paytonperryts @GovernorWinslow @RadioFreeTom It they want to spread disease and death, but will behave responsibly under duress, duress sounds great!
1,@IsrJablonski @AbigailAmerican @RadioFreeTom Or make the workplace safe.
1,@AllisonEdenArt @StevieVanZandt To state the obvious - vaccination’s 70-90% protection from infection is not 100%. You might as well argue against seatbelts and airbags in cars because deaths from collisions went down 75% and not 100%!
1,@AllisonEdenArt @StevieVanZandt The point of vaccination is not to make you indestructible, the point is to stop Covid from spreading. Once enough people are vaccinated that Covid is no longer spreading uncontrolled in the general population, we can safely do things like go to concerts.
1,@AllisonEdenArt @StevieVanZandt People who are vaccinated are 70-90% less likely to get infected, and if infected recover faster. Both reduce spread, which is what will ultimately keep us all safer.

B: Are you sure?
1,I don't know if he ever found a way to prevent them from taking up the seats, but he at least agreed to not deduct marks based on attendance. (His reasonableness was probably part of why he was the popular prof.)
1,I explained this to the prof, and said that instead of punishing his own students that can't attend his class, he should find a way to prevent students from other sections from taking up the seats meant for his students.
1,I had to decide between standing in linear algebra, leaving my other class early, or studying from the text on my own. I chose the latter as I was good at linear algebra (and I'd never had a math prof before (or since!) that cared about attendance).
1,I had another class on the other side of campus immediately before, so there was no way I could get to linear algebra early. I also couldn't switch to a different section, because of schedule conflicts.
1,The class had multiple sections, some taught by other profs. Mine happened to be the popular prof, so students scheduled for other sections would go to mine instead. So many would show up that you'd have to stand unless you arrived early.
1,I had one class, Linear Algebra 1, where the prof asked me to come to their office after the midterm. They said I was doing well on the tests and assignments, but was failing because I wasn't attending the class. https://t.co/EuW3hvtTg9
1,@RetroZo_ USB-C has the same problem, but worse: you can plug things in, but have to guess whether it'll actually work. With DVI, in theory it won't even plug in if the needed pins aren't there. (Of course, in practice it sometimes prevents you from connecting things that do work together)
1,@MonstersGo @BlitterObject Even if x was initialized, the next line modifies both x and y multiple times without an intervening sequence point. This code is undefined behavior golf: how much UB can one squeeze into as little space as possible?
1,@hqqns @dwculp @CodingAndThings @Dailycodinghab1 Not only that, but the assignment on the next line modifies both x and y without an intervening sequence point. It's undefined behavior.
1,@MOS_8502 If I'm starting vim in a separate window (ie: not in current terminal), I usually use gvim. I have a very small .gvimrc that sets guifont and a handful of other options.

The most undersold feature of gvim (vs vim) is that the cursor changes shape depending on mode.
1,@MOS_8502 I had no idea such a thing existed until just now, but I suppose a benefit of the left one is that it also keeps your socks on snugly.
